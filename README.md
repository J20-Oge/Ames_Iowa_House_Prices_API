# Ames_Iowa_House_Prices

This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. I used various techniques from data mining to visualization to supervised learning to accurately forecast housing prices in Iowa. 
The folder "Beautiful_API" contains files where I deployed the final Supervised Machine Learning model to production as an Application Interface (API) to predict house prices based on user inputs. To use it I would suggest dowloading postman on your PC. 
Enjoy!.
